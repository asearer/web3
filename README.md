# Web3 Projects

Welcome to my **Web3** collection! This repository contains a variety of projects that explore the world of decentralized applications, blockchain development, and smart contracts. The goal is to experiment, learn, and showcase practical implementations in Web3.

## Projects Included

Each project is self-contained and demonstrates a specific Web3 concept or technology. Some examples you might find here:

- **Smart Contracts** – Solidity contracts deployed on Ethereum testnets.
- **DApps** – Frontend applications interacting with smart contracts using Web3.js or Ethers.js.
- **NFTs** – Minting, transferring, and showcasing NFTs on different networks.
- **DeFi Experiments** – Simple decentralized finance applications and concepts.
- **Other Web3 Tools** – Utilities and small experiments exploring blockchain capabilities.

## Tech Stack

- **Blockchain Platforms:** Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain (testnets)
- **Smart Contract Language:** Solidity
- **Frontend Frameworks:** React, Next.js
- **Libraries & Tools:** Web3.js, Ethers.js, Hardhat, Alchemy, IPFS/Pinata

## Purpose

This repo is primarily for learning, experimentation, and demonstration. It’s a space to try new ideas, understand decentralized tech better, and showcase Web3 capabilities in action.
